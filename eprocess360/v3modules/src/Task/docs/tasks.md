**Tasks

Tasks are items assigned to Groups and/or Users:

* Controllers need the ability to add items to a User's Tasks.
* Tasks are completed by Users or Users in the Task assigned Group.
* When a Task is completed, fire triggers for the type of class.

The following data needs to be stored for each task:

* title "Review"
* description "#2 2400 Camino Ramon Suite 240"
* idProject "1234"
* endpointSubject "/phases/12/submittals/244"
* endpointCompletion "POST /phases/12/submittals/244/reviews
